## Usage

2. Verify the notebook you want to convert is executed and saved.
3. Copy & Paste the below code in a new code cell, at the bottom of the notebook and run it, to make a PDF:
    
```bash
!wget -O make.py https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JonasGMorsch/ColabMakePDF/master/make.py
import make; make.pdf()
```
or, for HTML:

```bash
!wget -O make.py https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JonasGMorsch/ColabMakePDF/master/make.py
